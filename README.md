# what is a web proxy?

- A web proxy is an intermediary server that acts as a link between the client and web server. Its main function is to intercept client requests and send them to the appropriate web server, and then send server responses back to the client.

  There are different types of web proxies, such as transparent proxies, anonymous proxies, and high anonymity proxies. Transparent proxies do not hide the client's IP address, while anonymous and high anonymity proxies do.

  Web proxies have several advantages, such as the ability to improve browsing speed by using caching, protect user privacy by hiding their IP address, and allow access to websites that may be blocked in the user's location.

  According to the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) documentation, a proxy is "an agent that acts on behalf of another, especially when it comes to requests or responses between client and server computer networks" [1]. The book "HTTP: The Definitive Guide" by David Gourley and Brian Totty defines a proxy as "an intermediary server that acts as a point of contact between clients and web servers" [2].
